<p>We provide two types of in-person training courses:</p>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-sm-6">
<center><h3>Public Courses</h3></center>

<p>Public courses are open to all attendees, and have the following advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Learn how folks from different industries are using R</li>
                <li>Network with useRs from both industry and academia</li>
                <li>Diverse training groups always lead to interesting live-coding challenges.</li>
            </ul>

<p>Our training partner <b>JB International</b> organises monthly R courses in London that can be <a href='https://jbinternational.co.uk/courses/r' target='_blank'>booked here</a>. </p>
<p>We deliver four courses annually for the Royal Statistical Society in London that can be <a href='https://rss.org.uk/training-events/training/public-courses/' target='_blank'>found here</a>.

<div class="col-sm-6">
<center><h3>Custom Private Courses</h3></center>

<ul>
<li>Course content can be customised for your team's needs</li>
<li>Internal datasets and problems can be discussed under an NDA agreement</li>
<li>Courses can be booked at your convenience, including in your own offices.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Why train with us?</h3>
            <p>Our focus is on developing delegate's skills in solving real-world problems by combining two pedagogical approaches:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structured lecture materials written in RMarkdown</li>
                <li>Live/group coding exercises customised on-the-fly for all delegates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We design courses for experts, complete beginners and entire data teams with mixed experience.</p>
