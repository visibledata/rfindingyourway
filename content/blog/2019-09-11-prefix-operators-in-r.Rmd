```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("emo")
library("askpass")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = FALSE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
```

Earlier today we were spelunking through the `add_tally()` function from `{dplyr}` and came across this wonderful line of code:

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mutate(x, `:=`(!!name, !!n))
```

That's an example of using **prefix notation** for something that we would normally write with **infix notation**. Let's compare the two:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">
**infix notation**
```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mutate(x, !!name := !!n)
```
</div>

<div class="col-xs-6">
**prefix notation**
```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mutate(x, `:=`(!!name, !!n))
```
</div>
</div>

Hadley Wickham makes clear in his [Advanced R book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#infix-functions) that most functions in R are written in prefix notation, e.g. `paste("hello", "world")` and `rep("hello world", 4)`. There are only a small number of built in functions that have a infix operator, and most of them are [arithmetic operators](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Arithmetic.html). 

Now we know how to re-write an infix operator in prefix notation, we can do something fairly special; we can swap the operator programmatically. Let's create a function where we can change the arithmetic operator applied to the first two [weird numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_number):

```{r, echo=TRUE}
swappable_operator <- function(prefix){prefix(70, 836)}
```

Now we can give any of the infix operators as the argument for our function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
swappable_operator(`+`)
## [1] 906
swappable_operator(`-`)
## [1] -766
swappable_operator(`*`)
## [1] 58520
```

That's quite fun, but there's not that much benefit to writing R code like this. However, in some other programming languages the ability to use prefix notation is incredibly useful. From 2012 - 2015 I was a Mathematica consultant for Wolfram Research and would use the following construction at least every other day:

```{wolframscript, echo=TRUE}
(*This is Wolfram Language code, NOT R*)
Accumulate@{1,2,4,16}
```

If anyone does have a good application for this prefix operator, please do let me know by replying to my tweet:
