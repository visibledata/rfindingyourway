<p><span style="color:purple">Fair warning: This post is about an interesting feature of the R language, it likely won‚Äôt help in your data analysis, wrangling or dataviz‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt stop it from being at least quite interesting.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today we were spelunking through the <code>add_tally()</code> function from <code>{dplyr}</code> and came across this wonderful line of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mutate(x, `:=`(!!name, !!n))</code></pre>
<p>That‚Äôs an example of using <strong>prefix notation</strong> for something that we would normally write with <strong>infix notation</strong>. Let‚Äôs compare the two:</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">
<p><strong>infix notation</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>mutate(x, !!name := !!n)</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">
<p><strong>prefix notation</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>mutate(x, `:=`(!!name, !!n))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hadley Wickham makes clear in his <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#infix-functions">Advanced R book</a> that most functions in R are written in prefix notation, e.g.¬†<code>paste("hello", "world")</code> and <code>rep("hello world", 4)</code>. There are only a small number of built in functions that have a infix operator, and most of them are <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Arithmetic.html">arithmetic operators</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know how to re-write an infix operator in prefix notation, we can do something fairly special; we can swap the operator programmatically. Let‚Äôs create a function where we can change the arithmetic operator applied to the first two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_number">weird numbers</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>swappable_operator &lt;- function(prefix){prefix(70, 836)}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can give any of the infix operators as the argument for our function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>swappable_operator(`+`)
## [1] 906
swappable_operator(`-`)
## [1] -766
swappable_operator(`*`)
## [1] 58520</code></pre>
<p>That‚Äôs quite fun, but there‚Äôs not that much benefit to writing R code like this. However, in some other programming languages the ability to use prefix notation is incredibly useful. From 2012 - 2015 I was a Mathematica consultant for Wolfram Research and would use the following construction at least every other day:</p>
<pre class="wolframscript"><code>(*This is Wolfram Language code, NOT R*)
Accumulate@{1,2,4,16}</code></pre>
<p>If anyone does have a good application for this prefix operator, please do let me know by replying to my tweet:</p>
