As far as I can tell, there’s not yet an R package for building this kind of thing:

    slider = new juxtapose.JXSlider('#initial-juxta',
        [{
                src: "/blog/2019-10-11-package-development-announcement-juxtaposer_files/r-logo_old.png",
                label: 'R logo (2000 - 2016)'
            },
            {
                src: "/blog/2019-10-11-package-development-announcement-juxtaposer_files/r-logo_new.png",
                label: 'R logo (2016 - today)'
            }
        ], {
            animate: true,
            showLabels: true,
            showCredits: true,
            startingPosition: "50%",
            makeResponsive: true
        });

That’s why I’m going to build <code>{juxtaposer}</code>; a <code>{htmlwidget}</code> package for embedding these image comparison tools into both RMarkdown documents and <code>{shiny}</code> apps.</p>
<p>Here’s my initial design for how the package will be used, before any code or user testing (so it likely change significantly!):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># function template
juxtaposer(data,
           juxtapose_size = list(width = &quot;100%&quot;,
                                 height = &quot;100%&quot;),
           starting_position = &quot;50%&quot;,
           show_labels = TRUE)

# data format
juxtaposer_imgs &lt;- tribble(
  ~image_handedness, ~image_url, ~image_label,
  &quot;left&quot;, &quot;img/r-logo_old.png&quot;, &quot;R logo (2000 - 2016)&quot;,
  &quot;right&quot;, &quot;img/r-logo_new.png&quot;, &quot;R logo (2016 - today)&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>I’m also going to blog the heck out of building this package. This is my third attempt to build a proper package, and all previous attempts have gone skewy due to a lack of documentation.</p>
<div id="why-call-it-juxtaposer" class="section level2">
<h2>Why call it juxtaposer?</h2>
<p>This is a <code>{htmlwidget}</code> package, which means it wraps a JavaScript package into R code that we can use without writing any JS ourselves. I’ve spent a few hours experimenting with different options, and JuxtaposeJS is the best looking and most feature-full option. On the <a href="https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/#preview-embed">JuxtaposeJS website</a> there’s even a WYSIWYG tool for creating interactive image comparison tools.</p>
<p>While the WYSIWYG tool is fairly useful, but it won’t allow us to modify the web element on the fly; for instance, changing changing the images in the tool, programmatically changing the slider position or styling the web element.</p>
<p>So, I wanted it to be obvious to users of the package that it depends on JuxtaposeJS. It’s also fairly obligatory to insert an <code>r</code> into your package name if you can, and the lovely <code>{avaialble}</code> package confirmed that <code>{juxtaposer}</code> is [currently] unused.</p>
