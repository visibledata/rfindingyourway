I've finally created an Automator application (<a href="/data/New-RStudio-Project.app" download>download here</a>) to create new RStudio Projects, and it works fairly nicely:

When I run the script I'm prompted for a project name (`tidytuesday-rock-salt`) which then creates the following new directory:

```{BASH}
/Users/charliejhadley/r-projects-scrapbook
â”œâ”€â”€ 15-05-2020_tidytuesday-rock-salt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tidytuesday-rock-salt.Rproj
```

... and voila, RStudio opens the project up ready to start work.

If the concept of RStudio Projects is new to you, please <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-r-tidyverse/why-should-you-use-projects-in-rstudio?autoplay=true&u=2125562" target="_blank">watch my video</a> explaining their benefits.

If your scripts contain `setwd()`, please follow @JennyBryan's advice and remove it!

Hadley Wickham shared his workflow for **opening** projects with Alfred back in 2018, but this only works for existing projects.

The excellent `{usethis}` package includes `create_project()` which achieves much the same thing as my script, but it requires RStudio to already be open. This can be a bit messy if you re-open RStudio in a state where lots of objects need to be loaded.

## Recreating this on your machine

This solution only works for macOS users. You can <a href="/data/New-RStudio-Project.app" download>download a copy of my application</a> onto your machine, it will *just work* provided you follow these instructions:

- Create a folder in your user directory called `r-projects-scrapbook`

- Create a subdirectory called `_template` and use a text editor to create a file named `rstudio-project-template.Rproj` that contains the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Version: 1.0

RestoreWorkspace: Default
SaveWorkspace: Default
AlwaysSaveHistory: Default

EnableCodeIndexing: Yes
Encoding: UTF-8

RnwWeave: Sweave
LaTeX: pdfLaTeX
```

This is the secret sauce behind RStudio Projects. The .Rproj file is a plain text file containing instructions on how RStudio should behave when it opens the project, my example makes RStudio behave according your preferences.

### Details of Automator workflow

Firstly, this workflow does not check if a duplicate project exists. The script does prepend project names with the date, in attempt to support folks who regularly create projects called `foobar` but it is not robust in any way.

If you want to recreate the workflow on your machine, follow these instructions:

Choose a location on your machine for your projects (`your-projects-home`), on my machine I chose `charliejhadley/r-projects-scrapbook`[^1]. Remember you must follow the instruction above to nest the `_template/rstudio-project-template.Rproj` file into this directory.

Open Automator > Choose **Application**

Add these actions:

1. **Ask for Text**

- Ensure that "require an answer" is selected, unnamed projects are bad

 2. **Set Value of Variable**
 
- This is the `project_name` we will use for creating the new folder and .Rproj file

 3. **New Folder**

The `Name:` field needs to formatted as follows:

- Add the **variable** `Today's Date`

  + Right-click the variable and select **Edit...**
  + Set Format: **Custom format...**
  + Drag the blocks into the field in the following order:
    - Day of Month (shown as **5**)
    - Month (shown as **January**)
    - Year (shown as **1999**)
  + Type a `-` between each of the blocks
  + Right-click the **5** entry and select **05**
  + Right-click the **January** and select **01**
  + Check that the date format is identical do **05-01-1999**
  + Click **done**
  
- Type a `_` after the `Today's Date` variable

- Drag the `project_name` variable after the `_`

Set the `Where` field to your chosen location for projects

 4. **Set Value of Variable**
 
- This `full_path` variable will be used to add the `.Rproj` file later

 5. **Find Finder Items**
 
In this application we're creating an empty project, in others we might want to select multiple files from our `_template` directory. 
 
This action will absorb the folder that we've just created, and the search results. For this reason we add the conditional.

- Set the search path to `your-projects-home/_template`

- Set the following condition:

  + **All** of the following are true
    - **Name is** `rstudio-project-template.Rproj`
    
 6. **Filter Finder Items**

Frustratingly, the previous action contains both the search results and the `full_path` directory. Add the same condition as before to discard the `full_path` directory:

- Set the following condition:

  + **All** of the following are true
    - **Name is** `rstudio-project-template.Rproj`
    
 7. **Copy Finder Items**
 
- Set the `Variable:` field as the `full_path` variable

 8. **Rename Finder Items**
 
- Set the initial field as **Name Single Item**

- Set `Name:` **Basename only** to `project_name`

 9. **Open Finder Items**
 
- Set `Open with:` to **RStudio.app**
