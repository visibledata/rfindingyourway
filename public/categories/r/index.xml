      <description>Shiny apps are awesome, with a bit of training you can build fairly impressive interactive web apps. But at some point, the subject of ‚Äúshiny modules‚Äù will rear its head.
When I started learning modules, I found most of the existing articles focus on the technical-side of things and don‚Äôt focus on the benefits of using modules - they can significantly simplify and improve your apps.
I‚Äôm going to put together a few different tutorials on real-world Shiny apps and how modules can be used to improve them.</description>

      <description>At least once a month I‚Äôm tasked with something that involves working with DOI, but I‚Äôve never bothered to write a function for extracting these from texts. Time to end that by putting together a tidyversesque add_doi() function!
‚Ä¶ wait, why?
The R for Data Science book has lots of excellent advice, including this snippet about reducing duplicated code by writing functions:
So, what are DOI? DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) are the gold standard for citations.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs hard keeping up to date with the awesome new things that we can do with #rstats. There are new packages and interesting new use cases of existing üì¶ coming out all of the time. Mara Averick (@dataandme) is an incredible source of overviews and introductions to awesome stuff, if you don‚Äôt already follow her then do so immediately.
But how about üì¶ updates? We often upgrade a package in a rush when we‚Äôre told the üì¶ we want to install requires a new version of X.</description>

      <description>Something I feel simulataneously confident &amp;amp; unconfident is whether I should give students handouts for my training courses before the event.
It‚Äôs difficult to get a good handle on what other folks do. I ran an extremely pitiful Twitter poll with 7 responses (43% give handsouts during the course, 29% give handouts before).
So I‚Äôve decided to create a survey of both students and trainers that I will try to spread as wide and broadly as possible.</description>

      <description>ggmap is an awesome package for creating maps with ggplot2. If you‚Äôve seen a nice looking map built with ggplot2 I can almost guarantee you that it uses ggmap to look that good. The ggmap package is used to obtain base maps from the APIs of a number of online mapping tools, the one we care about here is the base maps from Google Maps (because they‚Äôre very good).</description>
