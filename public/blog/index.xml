      <title>Shiny modules to reduce duplication in apps</title>

      <description>Shiny apps are awesome, with a bit of training you can build fairly impressive interactive web apps. But at some point, the subject of ‚Äúshiny modules‚Äù will rear its head.
When I started learning modules, I found most of the existing articles focus on the technical-side of things and don‚Äôt focus on the benefits of using modules - they can significantly simplify and improve your apps.
I‚Äôm going to put together a few different tutorials on real-world Shiny apps and how modules can be used to improve them.</description>

      <description>Shiny Modules are an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù feature of Shiny apps that developers can use to reduce code duplication, simplify complex inter-relating controls, allow UI elements to be compartmentalised into R packages‚Ä¶ and generally be a Shiny magician.
Much of the stuff written about modules gets lost in the weeds. We‚Äôre not going to do that here. We‚Äôre going to make the Shiny app I‚Äôve embedded below (as an iframe), both with and without modules.</description>

      <description>At least once a month I‚Äôm tasked with something that involves working with DOI, but I‚Äôve never bothered to write a function for extracting these from texts. Time to end that by putting together a tidyversesque add_doi() function!
‚Ä¶ wait, why?
The R for Data Science book has lots of excellent advice, including this snippet about reducing duplicated code by writing functions:
So, what are DOI? DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) are the gold standard for citations.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs hard keeping up to date with the awesome new things that we can do with #rstats. There are new packages and interesting new use cases of existing üì¶ coming out all of the time. Mara Averick (@dataandme) is an incredible source of overviews and introductions to awesome stuff, if you don‚Äôt already follow her then do so immediately.
But how about üì¶ updates? We often upgrade a package in a rush when we‚Äôre told the üì¶ we want to install requires a new version of X.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to keep secrets. For instance, if you want to use ggmap after July 2018 you need an API key and to provide billing details to Google. You definitely don‚Äôt want to accidentally include your personal API key in a blog post.
This blog is generated using the awesome blogdown package, which means all this wonderful stuff is generated from RMarkdown documents that are available in the Github repository visibledata/visibledata.</description>

      <description>Something I feel simulataneously confident &amp;amp; unconfident is whether I should give students handouts for my training courses before the event.
It‚Äôs difficult to get a good handle on what other folks do. I ran an extremely pitiful Twitter poll with 7 responses (43% give handsouts during the course, 29% give handouts before).
So I‚Äôve decided to create a survey of both students and trainers that I will try to spread as wide and broadly as possible.</description>

      <description>ggmap is an awesome package for creating maps with ggplot2. If you‚Äôve seen a nice looking map built with ggplot2 I can almost guarantee you that it uses ggmap to look that good. The ggmap package is used to obtain base maps from the APIs of a number of online mapping tools, the one we care about here is the base maps from Google Maps (because they‚Äôre very good).</description>

This Christmas it suddently hit me. There are probably enough festive coffees at Starbucks etc that you could use them to populate a very tasty advent calendar.
In the interests of helping everyone explore the range of Christmassy drinks on offer, I‚Äôll be updating my deposit 24 days of Christmass drinks on Figshare every year from now on.</description>

      <description>Content Warning: This is a navel gazing branding/workflow post.  Recently, Visible Data started using a fairly profesh looking signature in our emails. Each signature includes a link to the consultant‚Äôs availability via the excellent FreeBusy service.
   Why document an email signature? Well, there are some interesting features of a signature:

      <description>There are so many awesome folks in the #rstats community that I respect and have learned from over the last 3 years, I owe a lot of my development and growth to the great community behind #rstats. It‚Äôs been particularly rewarding and uplifting to read personal stories, conflicts with imposters syndrome and struggles with mental health episodes. There are some particularly inspiring or interesting posts or ideas that I‚Äôve found particularly useful, and will maintain a collection of humans and their stories at the bottom of this post.</description>

      <description>Visible Data is all
It‚Äôs extremely important to me to keep things reproducible and woke, here are some promises I commit to:
 Only using public datasets for which a DOI is available. Proprietary munging behind a paywall is acceptable
 Never use gender as a binary variable example (https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/971622753261572096).
 Spell check
 styler
 lintr
 Refuse to work outside of a file synchronisation system

      <description>Location  from: github.com/schloerke/leaflet-providers@urlProtocol
 Inspiration taken from https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers/commit/dea786a3219f9cc824b8e96903a17f46ca9a5afc to use the &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; relative url protocols and to &amp;lsquo;upgrade&amp;rsquo; them at js runtime.
  Notes&amp;hellip;  Copy/paste provider information into providers.json
var providers = L.TileLayer.Provider.providers; JSON.stringify(providers, null, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;);   ./data-raw/providerNames.R was re-ran to update to the latest providers  Some providers had their protocols turned into &amp;lsquo;//&amp;rsquo;.
 This allows browsers to pick the protocol To stop files from the protocols staying as files, a ducktape patch was applied to L.</description>
