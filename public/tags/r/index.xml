      <description>ggmap is an awesome package for creating maps with ggplot2. If you’ve seen a nice looking map built with ggplot2 I can almost guarantee you that it uses ggmap to look that good.

In the interests of helping everyone explore the range of Christmassy drinks on offer, I’ll be updating my deposit 24 days of Christmass drinks on Figshare every year from now on.</description>
