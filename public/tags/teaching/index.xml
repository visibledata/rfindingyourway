      <description>Something I feel simulataneously confident &amp;amp; unconfident is whether I should give students handouts for my training courses before the event.
It’s difficult to get a good handle on what other folks do. I ran an extremely pitiful Twitter poll with 7 responses (43% give handsouts during the course, 29% give handouts before).
So I’ve decided to create a survey of both students and trainers that I will try to spread as wide and broadly as possible.</description>
